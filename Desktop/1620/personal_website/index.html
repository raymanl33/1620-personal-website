        <p>
        I have been coaching Tennis for more than <strong>four years</strong> now and I still passionate about the sport. However, during the lockdown last year with the extra time on hand, I started to reflect on my <em>career goal</em>. I began to look into careers that allows for a remote working environment, and my curiosity in everyday technology led me to interest in the IT field. While I was originally accepted to a full-time CIT program at Langara, I found the BCIT programs to be more industry focused. I had to retake both English and Math 12 to meet the entry requirement but so far the effort has been worth while!

        The monitor with the laptop combo has been my go to set-up, as it allows for more screen real estate needed for school and entertainment. Upon acceptance to the program, I immediately tidied up my study room. Now I can say I am very satisfied and excited to continue my online studies until we are able to be back at the campus.
        I am grateful to be able to study online from my home in Richmond, BC. Nevertheless, I also miss my childhood home in Taiwan, which had by the way recorded zero local cases for 200 days. I am hopeful that 2021 will be the year where we can travel safely again!
