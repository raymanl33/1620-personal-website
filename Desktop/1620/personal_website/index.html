I have been coaching Tennis for more than <strong>four years</strong> now and I still passionate about the sport. However, during the lockdown last year with the extra time on hand, I started to reflect on my <em>career goal</em>. I began to look into careers that allows for a remote working environment, and my curiosity in everyday technology led me to interest in the IT field. While I was originally accepted to a full-time CIT program at Langara, I found the BCIT programs to be more industry focused. I had to retake both English and Math 12 to meet the entry requirement but so far the effort has been worth while!
